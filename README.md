# Hyperbolic Ray-Tracer

This project involves building a basic 3D renderer of hyperbolic space as a compute shader in Unity. I'm super excited about computer graphics and non-euclidean geometry, and having just learned a whole lot about Differential Geometry and having followed David Kuri's excelent GPU Ray Tracing in Unity tutorial (http://three-eyed-games.com/2018/05/03/gpu-ray-tracing-in-unity-part-1/), I thought I'd dip my toes in Unity and HLSL to try to make something interesting. So far this project includes:

* 2D examples of basic raymarching implemented in pygame
* HLSL code and associated C# script for the compute shader
